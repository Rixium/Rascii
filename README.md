There is a fantastic tutorial over at https://roguesharp.wordpress.com that guides you through the creation process.
This particular tutorial uses the Roguesharp framework with Monogame.
I opted to port this over to use just monogame, and invent a lot of the features that RogueSharp offers myself.
I have moved around a lot of the code that was given in the tutorial and come up with different methods in order to produce a similar effect,
but with more scalability.

You are free to use this code however you want.
